**This is work in progress!**

*strip_dilbert* is a simple image scrper written in Python for the well-known [dilbert.com](https://dilbert.com) comic website.

**What does it do?**
Well, the idea is to download the dilbert comic strip(s) for any day they've been published, starting from 16th April 1989 all the way till now.

The script will have a number of options, letting the user get the comics for the current week or month, for example.

Here's what the main menu will have:

1. **Today's comic strip:** *Downloads the comic for today*
2. **This week's strips:** *Downloads the comics for the current week - up till the current day*
3. **Last week's strips:** *Downloads the comics for last week*
4. **This month's strips:** *Downloads the comics for the current month - up till the current day*
5. **Last month's strips:** *Downloads all the comics for the previous month*
6. **CUSTOM DATE RANGE:** *Let's the user set the download date range (16/Apr/1989 - NOW)*

So, hopefully there are going to be some opportutnies for you with this script. ;)
